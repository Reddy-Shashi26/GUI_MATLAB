# **MATLAB Calculator GUI**

This is a **Calculator GUI** built using **MATLAB**, providing basic mathematical operations through a simple, user-friendly graphical interface.

## Overview

This project allows users to perform standard arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and more through an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) created in MATLAB. The app is designed to be easy to use for anyone seeking a quick way to calculate numbers without needing to type commands.
